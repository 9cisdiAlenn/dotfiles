# Dadagiriya Dinagalu: A Book on the Underworld of Bangalore
 
Dadagiriya Dinagalu is a book written by Agni Sreedhar, a former gangster and journalist, who narrates his experiences and observations of the underworld of Bangalore from 1974 to 1991. The book covers the rise and fall of notorious gangsters like M.P. Jayaraj, Kotwal Ramachandra, Muthappa Rai, Sreedhar, Oil Kumar and others, who ruled the city with violence and fear. The book also exposes the nexus between politicians, police and criminals, and how they influenced the history and politics of Karnataka.
 
The book was first published in Kannada language under the title Dadagiriya Dinagalu in 2011 by Ankita Pustaka[^1^]. It was later translated into English by S.R. Ramakrishna and published by Rupa Publications in 2013 under the title My Days in the Underworld: Rise of the Bangalore Mafia. The book received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award and the Atta Galatta-Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize. The book was also adapted into a Kannada movie called Aa Dinagalu in 2007, directed by K.M. Chaitanya and starring Chethan Kumar, Archana Gupta and Sharath Lohitashwa.

The movie Aa Dinagalu, which is based on the book Dadagiriya Dinagalu, is a realistic and gripping portrayal of the Bangalore underworld in the 1980s. The movie follows the story of Chethan, a young man who falls in love with Mallika, a dance teacher, and gets entangled in the rivalry between two gangsters, Kotwal Ramachandra and Jairaj. The movie also shows how the underworld was influenced by the political scenario of the state, especially the Emergency and the rise of Ramakrishna Hegde.
 
The movie was directed by K.M. Chaitanya, who made his debut with this film. The movie features a talented cast of actors, including Chethan Kumar, Archana Gupta, Sharath Lohitashwa, Ashish Vidyarthi, Atul Kulkarni, Girish Karnad and Dharma. The movie also has a memorable soundtrack composed by Ilayaraja, who used folk tunes and classical music to create a unique mood for the film.
 
The movie received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The Times of India gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars and praised the director for his brilliant portrayal of the underworld without showing violence[^1^]. The movie also won several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film - Kannada and the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Screenplay.
  
Dadagiriya Dinagalu and Aa Dinagalu are both remarkable works of art that depict the dark and violent side of Bangalore in the 1980s. They also show how the underworld was not just a criminal enterprise, but also a reflection of the social and political changes that were happening in the state and the country. They are both worth reading and watching for anyone who is interested in learning more about the history and culture of Karnataka.

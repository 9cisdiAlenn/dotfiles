## eww notes

i made a script to open and close eww widgets with my friend, see this in `~/.scripts/dash`, options of script:

  | option      | what this do? |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | `dash open` | open all eww widgets |
  | `dash close` | close all eww widgets |
  | `dash toggle`   | if the widgets are not open, this open the widgets, and if you execute again, close the widgets. |

## basic keys

  | key | what this do? |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | `super + enter` | open terminal (i use tym, but you can change it) |
  | `super + r` | open rofi (app launcher) |
  | `super + f` | open firefox (browser) |
  | `super + p` | open flameshot |
  | `super + m` | open spotify |
  | `super + c` | restart bspwm |
  | `super + alt + q` | quit bspwm |
  | `super + q` | close and kill a window |

## installation (arch and arch based)

1. clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/justleoo/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
```

2. install the packages

```
yay -S sxhkd bspwm feh zsh picom tym dunst spotify firefox nerd-fonts-complete
```

3. move the files 

```
cp .local/bin/* ~/.local/bin/
mkdir .scripts/
cp .scripts/* ~/.scripts/ 
chmod +x ./$HOME/.scripts/*
cp -r ./.config/* ~/.config/
chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
chmod +x ~/.config/eww/
```

~~i don't know exactly if this works, but it's supposed to work~~
